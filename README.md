Two simple programs as a quick template for creating password control using the getpass module, which asks for a user password but masks the input from displaying in the terminal.
The first program simply reads your .env file to verify user password before a welcome message. The second program adds a simulation to help unlock a user. Verifies admin again hypothetical admins list in loginAdmin(). 
You can use one therein or add your own data. Then, for the locked user, try user id "4501." It will display a simulated user, reply "y" to continue, "n" will loop back. 
hen it asks for a command type: "admin unlock" - exactly as shown without the quotation marks.  Be sure only one space is between the two words. From this basic functionality the program can be easily customized and expanded.
