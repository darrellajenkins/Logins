Two simple programs as a quick template for creating password control using the getpass module, which asks for a user password but masks the input from displaying in the terminal.
The first program simply reads your .env file to verify user password before a welcome message.
The second program adds a simulation to help unlock a user. Any admin id, first_name, last_name can be set. Then try user id "4501." It will display a simulated user, reply "y" to continue, "n" will loop back.
When it asks for a command type: <admin unlock> - exactly as shown without the "<>" and be sure one space is between the two words.
From this basic functionality the program can be easily customized and expanded.
